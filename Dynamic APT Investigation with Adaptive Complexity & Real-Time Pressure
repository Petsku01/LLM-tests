SECTION 1: ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Your Confidence Level Assessment:
Calculate your overall confidence: __%

IF confidence ≥80%:
  → Complete "High-Confidence Track" (Sections 1A, 2A, 3A)
  → Design disinformation campaign (Section 8A)
  → Recommend AGGRESSIVE containment
  
IF confidence 50-79%:
  → Complete "Medium-Confidence Track" (Sections 1B, 2B, 3B)
  → Enhance intelligence collection (Section 8B)
  → Recommend MEASURED response

IF confidence <50%:
  → Complete "Low-Confidence Track" (Sections 1C, 2C, 3C)
  → Focus on evidence preservation (Section 8C)
  → Recommend MONITORING only

State your confidence: __% 
Proceed with appropriate track:

SECTION 5: POLITICAL & EMOTIONAL PRESSURE DYNAMICS

Stakeholder Pressure Points:

A. CISO Message (T+15min): "The CEO wants us to avoid disclosure if possible. Can we contain this quietly?"

   - Legal/ethical consideration:

B. Board Member (T+30min): "My contact at TechCrunch just asked if we've been hacked. Did we leak?"
   Immediate actions (rank 1-3):
   [ ] Check employee social media
   [ ] Review external DNS queries for journalist domains
   [ ] Initiate leak investigation
   Justification:

C. Lead Engineer (T+45min): "I think I accidentally helped the attacker. I responded to a password reset that looked legitimate."
