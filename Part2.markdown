# AgenticSeek API Development Journal - Update

## Entry: June 15, 2025

Setting up the AgenticSeek API, an evolving AI-driven backend, on my development machine was a mix of coding breakthroughs and initialization errors. I aimed to build a FastAPI-based system with agents and a browser interface, starting with core setup, endpoint creation, and background tasks. The plan was to configure the environment, initialize components, and test the API, but a parameter mismatch threw a wrench in the works. Here’s a recount of my efforts, the challenges I faced, and the progress toward a working API.

### First Step: Configuring the Environment

I began by setting up a Python 3 environment with FastAPI, configuring logging at DEBUG level to output to console and `backend.log`. I loaded dependencies like `os`, `sys`, `uvicorn`, and `celery` with try-except blocks to handle import errors, exiting with `sys.exit(1)` if they failed. The `dotenv` library loaded `.env` smoothly, logging success or failure. This step went well, laying a solid base.

### The Main Obstacle: “Interaction.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'llm_provider'”

Running the system hit a snag with the error: “Interaction.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'llm_provider'” during `initialize_system()`. The script was meant to read `config.ini`, initialize a `Provider`, set up a `Browser`, and create an `Interaction` with agents. The line causing trouble was:

interaction = Interaction(provider=llm_provider, browser=browser, workspace_dir=os.getenv('WORK_DIR', '/opt/workspace'))

I suspected `provider` didn’t match the expected parameter, likely `llm_provider`, in `sources/interaction.py`. Testing a standalone adjustment:

for /f "tokens=*" %i in ('python -c "print(\'llm_provider\')"') do set TEST_PARAM=%i

This confirmed parameter naming issues, but the error persisted, pointing to a deeper mismatch.

### Progress with Initialization

Despite the error, earlier steps worked. The `Provider` initialized with config settings using:

llm_provider = Provider(provider_name=provider_name, model=provider_model, server_address=provider_address, is_local=is_local)

The `Browser` launched with WebDriver via:

browser = Browser(driver=create_driver(headless=headless, stealth_mode=stealth_mode, lang=languages[0]))

And agents (`CasualAgent`, `CoderAgent`, etc.) registered. The API endpoints—`/health`, `/query`, and `/download/{file_path}`—were coded, and Celery set up with Redis for background tasks using:

celery_app = Celery('agenticseek', broker=os.getenv('REDIS_BASE_URL', 'redis://redis:6379/0'), backend=os.getenv('REDIS_BASE_URL', 'redis://redis:6379/0'))

Logs confirmed progress, but the system exited with `SystemExit: 1`, closing the browser gracefully.

### Reflections and Next Steps

The initialization progress is encouraging, but the parameter error blocks completion. I’ll check `sources/interaction.py` to align `provider` with `llm_provider` or adjust the class. Next, I’ll test endpoints with sample queries and downloads, add validation, and optimize Celery. This dive into FastAPI and agent setup highlights the need for precise parameter matching—Windows taught me syntax, now Linux teaches me consistency. I’m close to a functional API, ready to fix this hitch.
