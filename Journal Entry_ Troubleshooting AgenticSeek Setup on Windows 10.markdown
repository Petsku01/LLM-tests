# Journal Entry: Troubleshooting AgenticSeek Setup on Windows 10

*Date: June 12, 2025*

Setting up AgenticSeek, an open-source AI research tool, on my Windows 10 machine was a rollercoaster of debugging batch scripts, Docker quirks, and PowerShell nuances. What I thought would be a quick setup—cloning the repository, configuring a few files, and launching services—turned into a deep dive into error messages and environment tweaks. Here’s a recount of my journey, the challenges I tackled, and the progress made toward getting AgenticSeek running.

## The Goal
AgenticSeek offers a local AI research environment with Docker containers for services like SearxNG, Redis, a frontend, and a backend, powered by a local LLM (like Deepseek-R1 via Ollama). My aim was to set it up in my project directory, start the services, and access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000` to try queries like “Make a snake game in Python!” The README guided me to clone the repo, rename `.env.example` to `.env`, configure `config.ini`, and run `start start_services.cmd full` to spin up Docker containers. It sounded straightforward, but Windows had other plans.

## First Step: Configuring the Environment
The README instructed renaming `.env.example` to `.env`. Since the Unix `mv` command doesn’t work on Windows, I used File Explorer to rename the file in the project directory. Alternatively, I could’ve used Command Prompt (`ren .env.example .env`) or PowerShell (`Rename-Item -Path .env.example -NewName .env`). I edited `.env` to set a working directory for file outputs and left API keys empty for local LLM use. This step was smooth, but it hinted at Windows-specific challenges ahead.

## The Main Obstacle: “use was unexpected at this time”
Running `start start_services.cmd full` in Command Prompt hit a wall with the error: **“use was unexpected at this time”**. This stopped the script in its tracks. The `start_services.cmd` script was meant to generate a secret key, stop existing Docker containers, and start services using `docker compose`. Digging into the script, I spotted a suspicious line: `docker stop $(docker ps -aq)`, which used Unix-style `$(...)` substitution—a likely culprit on Windows.

I replaced it with a Windows-friendly `for` loop:

```cmd
for /f "tokens=*" %%i in ('docker ps -aq') do docker stop %%i >nul 2>&1
```

This addressed the Unix syntax, but the error persisted, pointing to another issue in the script.

## Unraveling the Secret Key Generation
The script generated a `SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY` using:

```cmd
for /f %%i in ('powershell -command "[System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(64,0)"') do set SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY=%%i
```

Testing this command standalone revealed a new error: **“The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect”**. The PowerShell command worked alone, producing a 64-character password with special characters, but these (e.g., `&`, `>`) broke Command Prompt’s parsing. I switched to a safer alphanumeric generator:

```cmd
for /f "tokens=*" %i in ('powershell -command "$chars = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\"; -join ($chars.ToCharArray() | Get-Random -Count 64)"') do set SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY=%i
```

This hit a snag due to PowerShell’s quoting (`''...''` syntax). After adjusting to double quotes, I got a valid key, but the script still threw the “use” error, suggesting a deeper issue or environment quirk.

## Progress with Docker: The Backend Build
Despite the error, running `start_services.cmd full` eventually kicked off a Docker build for the `backend` service, as shown in the logs:

```
Building 52.8s (7/24) docker:desktop-linux
=> [backend internal] load build definition from Dockerfile.backend
=> [backend 1/19] FROM docker.io/library/python:3.11-slim
```

This was a breakthrough! The script was executing `docker compose up -d backend`, pulling the `python:3.11-slim` image, and building the custom `backend` image. The build was at 52.8 seconds, transferring a 4.23MB context, and still running. The README warned that image downloads could take 30 minutes, so the slowness was expected. A minor warning about `FROM --platform=linux/amd64` in the Dockerfile was noted but didn’t affect my x86_64 system.

I monitored the build with `docker ps` and `docker compose logs backend`, confirming it was in progress. The slow pace could be due to my system’s 8GB RAM and 8 CPUs (per `docker info`) or network speed. I suggested increasing Docker Desktop’s resource allocation and ensuring a stable connection.

## Reflections and Next Steps
The build’s progress is promising, but the “use was unexpected” error looms, possibly resurfacing after the build if the script’s `docker compose --profile full up -d` step fails. The updated `start_services.cmd` with a safe key generator and Windows-compatible syntax should help. As a fallback, I tested `docker compose` commands directly:

```cmd
docker compose up -d backend
timeout /t 5
docker compose --profile full up -d
```

Once the build finishes, I’ll test the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`, ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`, `ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b`), and explore the CLI (`start install.bat`, `python cli.py`). This journey underscored the pitfalls of cross-platform scripts on Windows—Unix syntax and PowerShell quoting were my nemeses. Docker’s WSL2 backend performed well, but patience is key for slow builds. I’m inches from a working AgenticSeek setup, ready to squash that “use” error and dive into AI research.
